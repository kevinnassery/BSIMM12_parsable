# BSIMM 12 Parseable Outputs

This is a small project to provide machine parseable BSIMM (Building Security in Maturity Model) version 12 framework data (in JSON format).

[Here](bsimm12.py) is the tool I used to parse BSIMMv12 SSF data from [bsimm.com](http://www.bsimm.com).

| file | descr | 
|------|--------|
| bsimm12.py   | This parses the data into JSON. |
| bsimm12.json | This is the JSON representation.| 
| bsimm12.psv  | This is a Pipe delimited file (suitable for excel import)|

* Note currently the only frequency data included for activity popularity is the BSIMM 'All Firms' aka 'Earth' data.

## BSIMM Licensing

The project is operated by [Synopsys](http://www.synopsys.com). The BSIMMv12 was authored by Sammy Migues, Eli Erlikhman, Jacob Ewers, and Kevin Nassery(me).

I am no longer an employee of Synopsys, and this leveraged no work product developed under my previous employment with Synopsys.
